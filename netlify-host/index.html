        A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to
        another computer program and its user, also known as the client. In a
        data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also
        frequently referred to as a server. That machine might be a dedicated
        server or it might be used for other purposes.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        In the client/server programming model, a server program awaits and
        fulfills requests from client programs, which might be running in the
        same, or other computers. A given application in a computer might
        function as a client with requests for services from other programs and
        as a server of requests from other programs.

      <h2 class="subheader">How servers work</h2>
      <p class="description">
        The term server can refer to a physical machine, a virtual machine or to
        software that is performing server services. The way that a server works
        varies considerably depending on how the word server is being used.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subheader-sub">Physical and virtual servers</h3>
      <p class="description">
        A physical server is simply a computer that is used to run server
        software. The differences between a server and a desktop computer will
        be discussed in detail in the next section.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        A virtual server is a virtual representation of a physical server. Like
        a physical server, a virtual server includes its own operating system
        and applications. These are kept separate from any other virtual servers
        that might be running on the physical server.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        The process of creating virtual machines involves installing a
        lightweight software component called a hypervisor onto a physical
        server. The hypervisor's job is to enable the physical server to
        function as a virtualization host. The virtualization host makes the
        physical server's hardware resources -- such as CPU time, memory,
        storage and network bandwidth -- available to one or more virtual
        machines.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        An administrative console gives administrators the ability to allocate
        specific hardware resources to each virtual server. This helps
        dramatically drive down hardware costs because a single physical server
        can run multiple virtual servers, as opposed to each workload needing
        its own physical server.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subheader-sub">Server software</h3>
      <p class="description">
        At a minimum, a server requires two software components: an operating
        system and an application. The operating system acts as a platform for
        running the server application. It provides access to the underlying
        hardware resources and provides the dependency services that the
        application depends on
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        The operating system also provides the means for clients to communicate
        with the server application. The server's IP address and fully qualified
        domain name, for example, are assigned at the operating system level.
      </p>
      <h2 class="subheader">Types of servers</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Servers are often categorized in terms of their purpose. A few examples
        of the types of servers available are as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="types">
        <p class="type">
          <span class="highlight">Web server</span>: a computer program that
          serves requested HTML pages or files. In this case, a web browser acts
          as the client.
        </p>
        <p class="type">
          <span class="highlight">Application server</span>: a program in a
          computer in a distributed network that provides the business logic for
          an application program.
        </p>
        <p class="type">
          <span class="highlight">Proxy server</span>: software that acts as an
          intermediary between an endpoint device, such as a computer, and
          another server from which a user or client is requesting a service
        </p>
        <p class="type">
          <span class="highlight">Mail server</span>: an application that
          receives incoming emails from local users -- people within the same
          domain -- and remote senders and forwards outgoing emails for
          delivery.
        </p>
        <p class="type">
          <span class="highlight">Virutal server</span>: a program running on a
          shared server that is configured in such a way that it seems to each
          user that they have complete control of a server.
        </p>
        <p class="type">
          <span class="highlight">Blade server</span>: a server chassis housing
          multiple thin, modular electronic circuit boards, known as server
          blades. Each blade is a server in its own right, often dedicated to a
          single application
        </p>
        <p class="type">
          <span class="highlight">File server</span>: a computer responsible for
          the central storage and management of data files so that other
          computers on the same network can access them.
        </p>
        <p class="type">
          <span class="highlight">Policy server</span>: a security component of
          a policy-based network that provides authorization services and
          facilitates tracking and control of files.
        </p>
        <p class="type">
          <span class="highlight">Database server</span>: this server is
          responsible for hosting one or more databases. Client applications
          perform database queries that retrieve data from or write data to the
          database that is hosted on the server.
        </p>
        <p class="type">
          <span class="highlight">Print server</span>: this server provides
          users with access to one or more network-attached printers -- or print
          devices as some server vendors call them. The print server acts as a
          queue for the print jobs that users submit. Some print servers can
          prioritize the jobs in the print queue based on the job type or on who
          submitted the print job.
